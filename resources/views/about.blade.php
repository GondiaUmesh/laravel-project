<h1>What is Gamification?</h1>
<br>
<h3>Gamification is a technique where designers insert gameplay elements in non-gaming settings so as to enhance user engagement with a product or service. By weaving suitably fun features such as leaderboards and badges into an existing system, designers tap usersâ€™ intrinsic motivations so they enjoy using it.</h3>
